## Survey of Employment, Payrolls, and Hours (SEPH)

[SEPH documentation](http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=2612)


> The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) provides a monthly portrait of the amount of earnings, as well as the number of jobs (i.e., occupied positions) and hours worked by detailed industry at the national, provincial and territorial levels.
>
> SEPH data provide the principal input to labour income estimates; they also serve as a proxy output measure for about 15% of real gross domestic product and 'nominal' gross domestic product. SEPH data are also used by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), to revise the maximum pensionable earnings and retirement savings plan contribution limits, and by the private sector, for contract escalations and wage rate determinations.
>
> Monthly survey estimates are produced by a combination of a census of payroll deductions, provided by the Canada Revenue Agency, and the Business Payrolls Survey (BPS), which collects data from a sample of 15,000 businesses. The BPS also collects information about job vacancies, supplemental to the SEPH (see Job Vacancy Statistics, record number 5202).
