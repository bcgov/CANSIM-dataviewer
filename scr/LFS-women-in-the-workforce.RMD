### Participation rate by age and sex


#### B.C. and Canada, Age == 25-44, Sex = Female

  filter(GEOGRAPHY %in% prov.list,
         AGEGROUP == "25 to 44 years",
         SEX == "Females",
         CHARACTERISTICS == "Participation rate (percentage)")

### basic
dataplot <- ggplot(thedata_long, aes(x=Ref_Date, y=Value, colour=GEOGRAPHY)) +

```


For B.C. in 2017, it was 82.4%. Nationally, it was 83.0%.

The participation rate rose rapidly in the mid-1970s through to about 1990, since then it has been rising more slowly. When Statistics Canada started the  Labour Force Survey in 1976, nationally the labour force participation rate for women aged 25-44 was 54%; it gained 10 percentage points over the next five years to reach 65.2% in 1981, and another 10 percentage points by 1988 (75.3%). The rate of increase since then has been much more modest.

The labour force participation of people aged 25-44 varies by sex. Males have higher participation rates, although the gap has closed significantly and continues to narrow.

## Labour force participation of women with children

### Background

On 2016-11-18, [Dr. Tammy Schirle](https://legacy.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=1805&f_id=31) posted [a series of tweets](https://twitter.com/tammyschirle/status/799616596750831616) via her twitter account (@tammyschirle), showing the proportion of Canadian women with young children, employed and at work, from 1976-2015.

The labour force participation of women with children has increased in a similar way. In 1976 in British Columbia, fewer than one in three women (28%) whose youngest child was under the age of three participated in the workforce; by 2017 it was just over 71%. The labour force participation of women with older children has also increased: three-quarters of women whose youngest child is between three and five years of age (75%) and four out of five women whose youngest child is between 6 and 15 (83%).

When Statistics Canada started measuring the national labour force in 1976, the participation rates of women with children was higher in B.C. than in Quebec, most notably for women whose youngest child was between 6 and 15 years of age. This persisted until the late 1990s, at which point the participation rate of women with children was higher in Quebec. This switch coincided with the introduction of policy measures regarding subsidized low-cost daycare.
